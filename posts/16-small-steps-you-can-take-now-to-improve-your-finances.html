<p>You have all kinds of financial goals you want to achieve, but where should you begin? There are so many different aspects of money management that it can be difficult to find a starting point when trying to achieve financial success. If you&#x27;re feeling lost and overwhelmed, take a deep breath. Progress can be made in tiny, manageable steps. Here&#x27;s are 16 small things you can do right now to improve your overall financial health. (See also: These 13 Numbers Are Crucial to Understanding Your Finances)</p>
<h2>1. Create a household budget</h2>
<p>The biggest step toward effective money management is making a household budget. You first need to figure out exactly how much money comes in each month. Once you have that number, organize your budget in order of financial priorities: essential living expenses, contributions to retirement savings, repaying debt, and any entertainment or lifestyle costs. Having a clear picture of exactly how much is coming in and going out every month is key to reaching your financial goals.</p>
<h2>2. Calculate your net worth</h2>
<p>Simply put, your net worth is the total of your assets minus your debts and liabilities. You&#x27;re left with a positive or negative number. If the number is positive, you&#x27;re on the up and up. If the number is negative — which is especially common for young people just starting out — you&#x27;ll need to keep chipping away at debt.</p>
<p>Remember that certain assets, like your home, count on both sides of the ledger. While you may have mortgage debt, it is secured by the resale value of your home. (See also: 10 Ways to Increase Your Net Worth This Year)</p>
<h2>3. Review your credit reports</h2>
<p>Your credit history determines your creditworthiness, including the interest rates you pay on loans and credit cards. It can also affect your employment opportunities and living options. Every 12 months, you can check your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) for free at annualcreditreport.com. It may also be a good idea to request one report from one bureau every four months, so you can keep an eye on your credit throughout the year without paying for it.</p>
<p>Regularly checking your credit report will help you stay on top of every account in your name and can alert you to fraudulent activity.</p>
<h2>4. Check your credit score</h2>
<p>Your FICO score can range from 300-850. The higher the score, the better. Keep in mind that two of the most important factors that go into making up your credit score are your payment history, specifically negative information, and how much debt you&#x27;re carrying: the type of debts, and how much available credit you have at any given time. (See also: How to Boost Your Credit Score in Just 30 Days)</p>
<h2>5. Set a monthly savings amount</h2>
<p>Transferring a set amount of money to a savings account at the same time you pay your other monthly bills helps ensure that you&#x27;re regularly and intentionally saving money for the future. Waiting to see if you have any money left over after paying for all your other discretionary lifestyle expenses can lead to uneven amounts or no savings at all.</p>
<h2>6. Make minimum payments on all debts</h2>
<p>The first step to maintaining a good credit standing is to avoid making late payments. Build your minimum debt reduction payments into your budget. Then, look for any extra money you can put toward paying down debt principal. (See also: The Fastest Way to Pay Off $10,000 in Credit Card Debt)</p>
<h2>7. Increase your retirement saving rate by 1 percent</h2>
<p>Your retirement savings and saving rate are the most important determinants of your overall financial success. Strive to save 15 percent of your income for most of your career for retirement, and that includes any employer match you may receive. If you&#x27;re not saving that amount yet, plan ahead for ways you can reach that goal. For example, increase your saving rate every time you get a bonus or raise.</p>
<h2>8. Open an IRA</h2>
<p>An IRA is an easy and accessible retirement savings vehicle that anyone with earned income can access (although you can&#x27;t contribute to a traditional IRA past age 70½). Unlike an employer-sponsored account, like a 401(k), an IRA gives you access to unlimited investment choices and is not attached to any particular employer. (See also: Stop Believing These 5 Myths About IRAs)</p>
<h2>9. Update your account beneficiaries</h2>
<p>Certain assets, like retirement accounts and insurance policies, have their own beneficiary designations and will be distributed based on who you have listed on those documents — not necessarily according to your estate planning documents. Review these every year and whenever you have a major life event, like a marriage.</p>
<h2>10. Review your employer benefits</h2>
<p>The monetary value of your employment includes your salary in addition to any other employer-provided benefits. Consider these extras part of your wealth-building tools and review them on a yearly basis. For example, a Flexible Spending Arrangement (FSA) can help pay for current health care expenses through your employer and a Health Savings Account (HSA) can help you pay for medical expenses now and in retirement.

<h2>11. Review your W-4</h2>
<p>The W-4 form you filled out when you first started your job dictates how much your employer withholds for taxes — and you can make changes to it. If you get a refund at tax time, adjusting your tax withholdings can be an easy way to increase your take-home pay. Also, remember to review this form when you have a major life event, like a marriage or after the birth of a child. (See also: Are You Withholding the Right Amount of Taxes from Your Paycheck?)</p>
<h2>12. Ponder your need for life insurance</h2>
<p>In general, if someone is dependent upon your income, then you may need a life insurance policy. When determining how much insurance you need, consider protecting assets and paying off all outstanding debts, as well as retirement and college costs. (See also: 15 Surprising Insurance Policies You Might Need)</p>
<h2>13. Check your FDIC insurance coverage</h2>
<p>First, make sure that the banking institutions you use are FDIC insured. For credit unions, you&#x27;ll want to confirm it&#x27;s a National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) federally-covered institution. Federal deposit insurance protects up to $250,000 of your deposits for each type of bank account you have. To determine your account coverage at a single bank or various banks, visit FDIC.gov.</p>
<h2>14. Check your Social Security statements</h2>
<p>Set up an online account at SSA.gov to confirm your work and income history and to get an idea of what types of benefits, if any, you&#x27;re entitled to — including retirement and disability.</p>
<h2>15. Set one financial goal to achieve it by the end of the year</h2>
<p>An important part of financial success is recognizing where you need to focus your energy in terms of certain financial goals, like having a fully funded emergency account, for example.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re overwhelmed by trying to simultaneously work on reaching all of your goals, pick one that you can focus on and achieve it by the end of the year. Examples include paying off a credit card, contributing to an IRA, or saving $500.</p>
<h2>16. Take a one-month spending break</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, you can never take a break from paying your bills, but you do have complete control over how you spend your discretionary income. And that may be the only way to make some progress toward some of your savings goals. Try trimming some of your lifestyle expenses for just one month to cushion your checking or savings account. You could start by bringing your own lunch to work every day or meal-planning for the week to keep your grocery bill lower and forgo eating out.
